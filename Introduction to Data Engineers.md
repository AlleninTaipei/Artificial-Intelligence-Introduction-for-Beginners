# Introduction to Data Engineers

## What is a Data Engineer?

In recent years, the role of a data engineer has become extremely popular, particularly due to the rise of big data. Simply put, the primary job of a data engineer is to provide usable data to data users, which may include data analysts, data scientists, and various business units within the company such as the marketing department, HR department, etc.

## The Role of Data Engineers in a Team

Data engineers are responsible for organizing and providing data to other roles within the data team, such as data analysts and data scientists. Data analysts explore surface information and trends from the data, while data scientists delve deeper to uncover hidden values and make predictions.

## Scope of Work for Data Engineers

The work of a data engineer can be divided into several main parts:

1. **Data Collection**: Writing web crawlers to collect data.
2. **Database Management**: Ensuring data storage and management.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Handling dirty data and converting it into an analyzable format.
4. **Model Deployment**: Ensuring the operation and maintenance of models.

## Other Roles in the Team

- **Data Analyst**: Explores information from data, conducts reports, and insights.
- **Data Scientist**: Digs deeper into data, builds predictive models.
- **Data Analytics Engineer**: Bridges the gap between data engineers and data analysts, providing usable data.
- **Machine Learning Engineer**: Ensures the deployment and operation of machine learning models.

## Required Skills

To become a data engineer, you need the following skills:

1. **Data Understanding**: Knowledge of data sources and storage.
2. **Engineering Development**: Knowledge of software engineering and system architecture.
3. **Team Collaboration**: Understanding the needs of analysts and scientists, collaborating to handle data.

## Background of Data Engineers

Data engineers come from diverse backgrounds, including computer science, statistics, and even other industries. The key is their understanding of data and engineering.

## Workflow of Data Engineers

1. **Data Collection**: Writing web crawlers and other tools to collect data.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming data to make it usable for analysis.
3. **Automated Processing**: Building automated data pipelines to ensure the automatic collection, organization, and storage of data.
4. **Model Deployment**: Deploying trained models as commercial products, ensuring they can operate in real environments.

## Technical Tools

Data engineers need to master various tools, including cloud services (GCP, AWS, Azure), distributed systems, container technology, scheduling tools, and streaming processing systems.

## Data Engineers in Taiwan

The data engineering market in Taiwan is gradually growing, with salaries ranging from 1 million to 2 million NTD, and the trend is upward. As foreign companies increase their demand for remote data engineers, job opportunities and salaries for data engineers have also risen.

## Suggestions for Becoming a Data Engineer

1. **Diverse Background**: Not necessarily from a computer science background; statistics, business analysis, etc., can also be a fit.
2. **Skill Development**: Focus on developing data processing and engineering development skills.
3. **Tool Mastery**: Familiarize yourself with mainstream tools and technologies in the market.
4. **Practical Experience**: Improve your skills through actual projects.
