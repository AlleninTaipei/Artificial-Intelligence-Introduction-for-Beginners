## [LLM: Parameters and Memory Estimation](https://github.com/AlleninTaipei/Artificial-Intelligence-Introduction-for-Beginners/blob/main/LLM%20Parameters%20and%20Memory%20Estimation.md)

Understanding the memory requirements of models is vital for optimizing deployment and usage. It impacts the choice of hardware and the overall cost.

Discover a practical estimate for the VRAM needs of a system, based on a general understanding, along with viable solutions available on the internet.

By framing the information in terms of scaling laws, it becomes clear how each factor contributes to the overall performance and what trade-offs must be considered when **scaling up LLMs.**

## [Distinction between NPUs and GPUs](https://github.com/AlleninTaipei/Artificial-Intelligence-Introduction-for-Beginners/blob/main/Distinction%20between%20NPUs%20and%20GPUs.md#distinction-between-npus-and-gpus)

The features of NPU design enable it to achieve higher energy efficiency compared to traditional GPUs when handling AI computations. 

This means that for the same computational workload, the energy required by an NPU will be significantly lower. 

For businesses, this not only translates to cost savings but also aligns with global environmental sustainability trends.

## [SLMs - Small Language Models ](https://github.com/AlleninTaipei/Artificial-Intelligence-Introduction-for-Beginners/blob/main/SLMs%20-%20Small%20Language%20Models%20.md)

*Microsoft Phi-3 small model is inspired by "daughter's bedtime story"*

Windows Copilot Runtime introduces new ways to interact with operating systems that leverage AI, such as the Small Language Model (SLM) built by Microsoft Research, which provides many of the same capabilities found in large language models (LLM), but is more streamlined and More efficient so that it can be executed natively on Windows.
